CardPack: Card Game Package
====================================

Cardpack is a small yet powerful card game package, that helps you create command line card games at the drop of a hat.

The best way to learn the Python basics, is by working on your own projects. Card games are popular projects for beginning programmers. When trying to get it right, you will encounter all kinds of problems to solve, that are also common when you are creating something more serious with Python. Your Python skills will improve rapidly when you work on command line card games. 

During my own Python studies, which are still continuing, I have made several miniature command line (card) games, that I am fond of. Some of them can be found at www.github.com/mejongetje. The classes and functions I have written for those programs form the foundation for the Cardpack package.

The Cardpack package is my first effort to create a Python package. I consider Cardpack to be a study project for myself, but I’m convinced it can be useful for others too. Hopefully Cardpack will find its way to a few aspiring programmers and motivate them to create their own card games and learn some new skills along the way. 

Full documentation of the Cardpack package can be found at …readthedocs.com… And there is also a short course on how to program a game of whist with the help of Cardpack, which you can also find at my github repository, www.github.com/mejongetje.

For the next version of Cardpack I am planning to add functionality for the games of Poker and Blackjack.

Looking forward to your comments and suggestions to improve Cardpack.
